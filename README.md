# üèÄ BRScraper

Python package for easy access to basketball data through scraping of [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) website.

This allows users to obtain statistics, standings, and scores for various seasons and phases of the following tournaments:
- **NBA**
- **G-League**
- **International Tournaments** (Olympics, EuroLeague, EuroCup and international leagues from: Spain, Australia, China, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Turkey, Russia and ABA)

## üöÄ Installing
### Via `pip`
This library was written as an exercise for creating my first PyPi package. Hopefully you will find it valuable!
Install with the following command:

```
pip install BRScraper
```

## üìñ Documentation
For documentation about the API methods refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/GabrielPastorello/BRScraper/blob/main/API.md).

# All players stats per game regular season
nba.get_stats(2023, info='per_game', playoffs=False, rename=False).head()
